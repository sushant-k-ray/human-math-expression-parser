# Human Math Expression Parser

## About
this project is a simple math expression parser which handles many cases where some operator is implicitly present. The included test.cpp is very handy in using this library

*Note* : A C++ 17 compliant compiler is required to build the project

---
## Usage
Include header file
`#include "expression_parser.h`
and then execute
`expressionParser::solve("some string")`

*Note* : All the exceptions are handled by expressionParser::exception object

## Known Bugs
Let me know if there are any
